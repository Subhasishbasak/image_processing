This repository contains the projects/assignments for my post-graduate course-work at CMI for **Computer Vision : Image Processing & Recognition : CGE-136**, which I took during Spring 2020.

### directory layout
folders containing `.py` and `.ipynb` notebooks. `.pdf` documentations are available most of the cases.
